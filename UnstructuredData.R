#Multiple strings are often stored in a character vector, which you can create with c():
c("I am Sujata", "I am in my 2nd year of masters", "I love cooking")

#To combine two or more strings, use str_c()
str_c("I am Sujata","I am in my 2nd year of masters")

#Use the sep argument to control how they’re separated:
str_c("I am Sujata","I am in my 2nd year of masters", sep = ",")

#String length

# Subsetting strings
#You can extract parts of a string using str_sub(). As well as the string, str_sub() takes start and end arguments which give the (inclusive) position of the substring:
x <- c("Apple", "Banana", "Pear")
str_sub(x, 1, 3)
#> [1] "App" "Ban" "Pea"
# negative numbers count backwards from end
str_sub(x, -3, -1)
#> [1] "ple" "ana" "ear"
